## Irrelevant search queries cannot return empty results

During the score summary, when the semantic and keyword search are merged, we lose the score and only get a rank because BM25 and cosine similarity score on different scales. This means that even the first result might be a poor match. 

## Deep integration with the R ecosystem

pkgmatch is designed to search within the R ecosystem. The main benefit is that everything is fit for purpose and streamlined, for documentation & code extraction to embedding calculation.

But it also means adding python libraries in the universe of results is not straightforward.
